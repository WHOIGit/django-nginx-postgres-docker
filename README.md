# django-nginx-postgres-docker
A Docker Compose starter kit with Nginx, Django, Gunicorn, and Postgres database. You can use this as a template to build out your own Django application for development or production. The Postgres data is saved locally in the `postgres` directory, and any changes saved to the database while the app is running will persist.  Static and media files are configured to be served by Nginx, and stored locally in the `static_volume` and `media_volume` directories.

## Nginx configuration
The default Nginx configuration file can be found at`nginx/djangoapp.conf`.  It's set to run the site for local development at http://localhost:8000

## Postgres configuration
Default Postgres setting can be found in `config/db/database1_env`. The Postgres Docker image will automatically create a database with these settings when the container is started. We use `database1` everywhere for default values, but you can change these values to whatever suits you:

    POSTGRES_USER=database1_role  
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=database1_password  
    POSTGRES_DB=database1

If you change these values, you must also update the DATABASES code block in the `settings.py` file in the Django application

    DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'database1',
        'USER': 'database1_role',
        'PASSWORD': 'database1_password',
        'HOST': 'database1',  # <-- IMPORTANT: same name as docker-compose service!
        'PORT': '5432',
        }
    }

And match the container name in the `docker-compose.yml` file for the Postgres container.

    database1:  # <-- IMPORTANT: same name as in Djano settings.py, otherwise Django won't find the database!
    image: postgres:11
    container_name: database1
    env_file:  # <-- match values to Djano settings.py
      - config/db/database1_env
    networks:
      - database1_network  
    volumes:
      - ./postgres/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data # <-- bind the database to local directory

## Install Instructions
Prerequisite: You need to have Docker installed on the system where you'll be running this app. [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

1. Using your command line interface, `cd` to the cloned directory containing the docker-compose.yml file.
2. Run `docker-compose build` to download and build the required Docker images.
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the Django application (the `-d` flag starts the containers as background daemons to they will continue to run if the terminal session is ended).
4. The first time the application is run, you need to execute the usual Django management commands to perform database migrations, create a super user, and collect static files:
    1. SSH to the Django container by running `docker exec -it djangoapp bash`. Now you're inside the Django container.
    2. Run `cd starterkit`
    3. Run `./manage.py migrate`
    4. Run `./manage.py createsuperuser`
    5. Run `./manage.py collectstatic`
    6. Run `exit` to leave the container     
5. Django site up! http://localhost:8000 
6. To stop the application, run `docker-compose down`
